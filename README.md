## Features
PROLEAD allows to analyze the robust probing security of masked implementations provided as a verilog netlist or arm binary. In particular, PROLEAD supports the following features:
- Consideration of glitches and transitions (simultaneously) 
- Univariate and multivariate adversaries

## Documentation
All information about the features and use of PROLEAD can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/ChairImpSec/PROLEAD/wiki">Wiki</a>.

## Examples
Some selected examples can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/ChairImpSec/PROLEAD/tree/main/examples">examples</a> folder. More information regarding the examples can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/ChairImpSec/PROLEAD/wiki/Examples">Wiki</a>. We will provide more examples soon.

## Contact and Support
Please contact Nicolai Müller (nicolai.mueller@rub.de) if you have any questions, comments, if you found a bug that should be corrected, or if you want to reuse PROLEAD or parts of it for your own research projects.
